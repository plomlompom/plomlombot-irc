Primitive IRC bot.

Expects some external Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt). May be run
directly if those dependencies are met. Otherwise, if at least pyvenv and pip
are installed, run the bot via ./run.sh to set it up in a virtual environment
into which the required libraries get installed automatically.
